<h1> MY HOBBIES</h1>
<div class="hobby-content">
<h2> Painting</h2>
<p>Painting is just more than putting colour on paper -it's an outlet for personal expression, a way to boost your mental health and an activity that grows with you over time. Painting is a profound expression of creativity and emotions that enriches my life in countless ways. It helps me relieve stress and enhances my creativity.</p>

<h2> Photography</h2>
<p> Capturing memories through photos is my favourite hobby. When you go through photos, it reminds you of that event and can bring you right back to the feelings, sounds and even smells of the moment.</p.


<h2>Travelling</h2>
<p>travelling can be a fun hobby that helps you learn about new cultures , develop skills and make lasting memories

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>Listening to music is another hobby of mine. It helps me to calm down as well as it enhances my mood. I love to listen to calm songs for reminding after a long day </p>
